== The OpenShift Data Science Dashboard

You should be logged into *Red Hat OpenShift Data Science*, and be able to see the dashboard, that looks like this:

NOTE: If you're at the OpenShift Web Console and need to navigate back to the OpenShift Data Science Dashboard, use the *Application Switcher* Icon in the top right of the navigation bar.

*Red Hat OpenShift Data Science* brings you on-demand Jupyter Notebook environments. Don't worry if you've never used notebooks before as this workshop will start with a small tutorial on what they are and how to use them.

* Now that you are logged into to *Red Hat OpenShift Data Science*, click on the "Launch" link on the JupyterHub card:

== JuptyerHub

If it's the first time you're launching Jupyter, you will be sent to a page that will require you to login and ask for your authorization to use your user account to authenticate to Jupyter. You should of course allow this if you want to do the workshop...

Once you have authorized access, you will be taken to the JupyterHub "Spawner Options" page.

* From the "Start a notebook server" page, there are multiple options you can choose from to launch your environment.
 ** For the *Notebook Image* , select *TensorFlow* (`Python v3.8.6, Tensorflow v2.4.1`), as this is the flavor of notebook we want to use. It includes the TensorFlow library, which is used to do object detection.
 ** From the *Container size* dropdown, select `Default`.
 ** At the bottom of the page you can now click on the *Start Server* button:

IMPORTANT: If you do not pick the correct notebook image, *TensorFlow*, the notebooks in the following sections will fail to run since they do not have the correct Python libraries.  +
If you need to restart your notebook server with the correct image, you can do so from *File* -> *Hub Control Panel* in the notebook environment in the next section.

While your environment is starting,  xref:1-02-jupyter-env.adoc[let's go to the next section.]
