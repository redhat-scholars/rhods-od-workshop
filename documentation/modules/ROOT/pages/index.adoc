== Introduction

Welcome!

In this workshop, you'll learn an easy way to incorporate data science and AI/ML into an OpenShift development workflow.  As an example, you'll use an object detection model in several different ways.

You will:

* use Jupyter Notebooks and TensorFlow to explore a pre-trained object detection model
* serve the model in a REST API as a Flask App
* use source-to-image (s2i) to build and deploy the Flask App
* explore Kafka streams from notebooks
* deploy a Kafka consumer with the same object detection model

And all of this without having to install anything on your own computer, thanks to *Red Hat OpenShift Data Science* and *Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka*.
